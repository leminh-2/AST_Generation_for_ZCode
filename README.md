# AST Generation

This repository contains the code for Assignment 2 of the Principles of Programming Languages (CO3005) course at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you will be able to:

- Explain the structure of the parser generated by ANTLR.
- Manipulate (traverse, create) on trees, which have different types of nodes, using Visitor.
- Write a short program in Python to generate intermediate code (AST) for a valid ZCode program.

## Specifications

To complete this assignment, you need to:

1. Download the initial code (`assignment2-initial.zip`) and unzip it.
2. Copy your `ZCode.g4` and your solution from Assignment 1 into the `src/main/zcode/parser` folder.
3. Examine the `src/main/zcode/utils` folder, where the `AST.py` file defines all the classes in the AST used as the output of this assignment. You are NOT allowed to modify this file.
4. Modify `ASTGeneration.py` in the `src/main/zcode/astgen` folder to generate an AST from a parse tree (the result of Assignment 2) generated by ANTLR.
5. Modify `ASTGenSuite.py` in the `src/test` folder to create at least 100 tests in total for this assignment.

## Submissions

This assignment requires you to submit your code in 10 files: `ZCode.g4`, `ASTGeneration.py`, `ASTGenSuite.py`, and 7 files generated by ANTLR. Even if `ZCode.g4` is not modified, it must still be submitted. Do not compress your files when submitting them.

All the test cases for this assignment are grammatically correct.

You must complete the assignment by yourself and not let your work be seen by someone else, or use someone else's work as your own, as this will be considered plagiarism and punished according to the university's rules.
